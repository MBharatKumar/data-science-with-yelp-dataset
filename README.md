# data-science-with-yelp-dataset
we did a data analysis on yelp data set. here I have compared Random Forest, K-Nearest neighbor and decision tree algorithm and have tried to predict the rating given by user depending upon the review written by the user, with the help of natural language processing.

install python 3 and jupyter notebook on your PC copy the codes and you can start working on it 

the folder contains the data set i have used and the analysis and prediction i have done. I have added detailed comments in the ipynb file, it wont be difficult for you to understand
